# VisionTransformer


The information in <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/understand-and-implement-vision-transformer-with-tensorflow-2-0-f5435769093">this</a>
helped me understand how vision transformers work and how to write my code.


## Python Environment
In order to run the code, simply create the python environment:
```shell
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```
This will create a python environment called 'vit'.

# Image Quality Metrics

The idea of this topic, is to apply some simple and fast quality metrics to an image to assess whether
the image is of high quality (sharp) or not (blurry).


## Python Environment
Create the python environment with the yaml file:
```shell
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

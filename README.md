# Computer Vision


## Introduction
I created this repo simply to play around and learn. I'm going over various topics all related to computer vision.
Sometimes I use existing code or packages, but most of the time I write my own code because I want to understand
how the models/methods work.


## How it works
Every folder is basically a project. Every project has a readme that explains how to create the python environment
for that particular project. If there is no explanation in the readme, just create the environment with 
`conda env create -f environment.yaml`. If there is no readme, then I guess there's not much to say, just create the
environment and run the code.
A small disclaimer: in the earlier projects I tried to use one environment yaml for all the projects. I realized that
was a bad idea and started creating an environment per project. This means that the environment yamls from some of the 
earlier projects might not work out of the box.

I am playing around a bit with environment yamls and requirements.txt files. Also, in every project I either user 
tensorflow or pytorch. My earlier projects mainly use tensorflow, but I started liking pytorch more and more.

Some projects will have more elaborate coding where I spent more time while other projects I quickly wanted to try
out something.

# Neural Style Transfer


The code is based on <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/style_transfer">this</a> 
tensorflow tutorial.

## Make your own creation
To start the script in the background for generating an image, you
can use (make sure you have activated the right python environment):
```bash
nohup python YOUR_COMMAND > YOUR_LOG_FILE.log 2>&1 &
```
`neural_style_transfer/generate_stylized_image.sh` has some template
code to execute the appropriate script.
